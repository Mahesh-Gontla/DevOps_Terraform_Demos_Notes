dependencies-->implicit and explicit

saikiranpi-->github repo-->Git-Terra 
implicit dependencies-->vpc with their related sub components like Subnets,RT's,IGW...etc.,

create three s3 buckets using TF 

I want to create my vpc configuration first then s3 bucket has to be create 
We can achieve this by using the explicit dependency

depends_on = [aw_route_table_association.public]
the bucket will create after the route table association 

i want to create my second bucket after first bucket creation and want to create third bucket after the second bucket creation 
For this we can use nested depends_on

depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.nameoftheresourceofs3bucket]

variables and terraform.tfvars

create before destroy +/-
prevent to destroy -/+

change the key name in variables  like wrong key --ke-->Terraform will delete the entire instance and will recreate it

google-->create before destroy terraform

lifecycle{
  prevent_destroy = true
}

lifecycle{
  create_before_destroy = true
}
