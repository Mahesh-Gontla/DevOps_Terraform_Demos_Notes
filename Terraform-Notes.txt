Terraform-->is a openource IAAC Tool developed by hashicorp
    -->Using TF we can write the code to define and provision infrastructure using a a declarative configuration language called hashicorp configuration language(HCL)
    -->We can also write the code for creating the resources like compute,storage,databases,network etc
    -->Multi-Cloud Support

Declarative approach -- we can define the desired state of our infrastructure(what do you want) and we can avoid manual errors

State management--it will keeps the track of our infrastructure in a state file
